## PURPOSE OF PORTFOLIO:

- The purpose of my portfolio site is to display my experiences in life, the work that I have done / been apart of and areas that interest me. In return if this then brings opportunity for jobs, businesses or others to work with me I would be greatly appreciative. I wanted the site to be displayed in a clean and tidy way still while challenging myself and making it standout from the crowd. I've loved the challenge of working on my portfolio and what I have made it into. This will be an ongoing development to ensure it is always up to date.
